`game` dataset includes every game from 1871 till 2016 and every detail of the game.
`park` dataset includes information from every park, identified by id and name.
`person` includes information from every player
`team` includes information from every team, identifies by team id.

# Looking for opportunities to normalize tables

* In person_codes, all the debut dates are in game_log.
* In team_codes, the start, end and sequence columns are in game_log.
* In park_codes, the start and end years are in game_log. 
* In game_log we have players_name. They are also in person_codes.
* In game_log, all offensive and defensive stats are repeated for the home team and the visiting team. We could break these out and have a table that lists each game twice, one for each team, and cut out this column repetition.
* Similarly, in game_log, we have a listing for 9 players on each team with their positions - we can remove these and have one table that tracks player appearances and their positions.
* We can do a similar thing with the umpires from game_log, instead of listing all four positions as columns, we can put the umpires either in their own table or make one table for players, umpires and managers.
* We have several awards in game_log like winning pitcher and losing pitcher. We can either break these out into their own table, have a table for awards, or combine the awards in with general appearances like the players and umpires.

# Creating game table

Considerations:

* Included all columns for the game_log that don't refer to one specific team or player, instead putting those in two appearance tables.

* Removed the column with the day of the week, as this can be derived from the date.

* Changed the day_night column to day (boolean column)
